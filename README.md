# Smart-Wallet
This is my Final Assignment for a free 1-month HTMl, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JS Bootcamp by Programming Hero.

I used HTML for basic structure and Tailwind CSS for design
I used JS for buttons, Login Credentials Validation and the main functionalities of the wallet (i.e. calculation of deposit, Withrow money)

This project has 3 individual pages. 
 - Landing Page: This page is about what Smart Wallet is about.
 - Login Page: This page allows users to log into their account.
 - Wallet Page: This is the page where users can manage their money (i.e. Deposit, Withrow, Total Earnings etc.)
